Every day people make decisions that belong within the realm of 
economics. What to buy? What to make and sell? How many hours to 
work? We have all participated in the economy as consumers, many of us 
as workers, some of us also as producers. We have paid taxes. We have 
saved our earnings in a bank account. All of these activities (and many 
more) belong to the realm of economics. Households and firms are the 
basic units of an economy and are concerned with the economic problem: 
how best to satisfy unlimited wants using the limited resources that are 
available? As such, economics is the study of how society uses its scarce 
resources. Its aim is to provide insight into the processes governing the 
production, distribution and consumption of goods and services in an 
exchange economy. 
The previous paragraph could be taken to imply that the ‘realm of 
economics’ is limited and clearly defined. However, if economics is 
viewed as a way of thinking, or a set of tools that can be used to analyse 
human behaviour and the world around us, then you will find that the 
principles of economics can be applied to many different areas of life. The 
scope is thus very broad, but the principles of analysis are well defined 
and these are what you will become familiar with through undertaking 
this course. Although the course provides some information that is 
descriptive, such as how the banking system works, for example, its main 
focus is on introducing models and concepts which are used as tools of 
economic analysis. Concepts such as opportunity cost and approaches 
such as marginal analysis can be widely applied and prove very useful in 
understanding various aspects of society and people’s lives.
