Operations research, or operational research in British usage, 
is a discipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical
methods to help make better decisions.[1] Further, the term 'operational 
analysis' is used in the British (and some British Commonwealth) military,
as an intrinsic part of capability development, management and assurance. 
In particular, operational analysis forms part of the Combined Operational 
Effectiveness and Investment Appraisals (COEIA), which support British 
defence capability acquisition decision-making.
