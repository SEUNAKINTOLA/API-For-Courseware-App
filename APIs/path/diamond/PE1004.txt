Human Resources is a business field focused on maximizing employee productivity.
Human Resources professionals manage the human capital of an organization and 
focus on implementing policies and processes. They can be specialists focusing
in on recruiting, training, employee relations or benefits. Recruiting specialists 
are in charge of finding and hiring top talent. Training and development 
professionals ensure that employees are trained and have continuous development. 
This is done through training programs, performance evaluations and reward programs.
Employee relations deals with concerns of employees when policies are broken, such
as harassment or discrimination. Someone in benefits develops compensation structures,
family leave programs, discounts and other benefits that employees can get. On the 
other side of the field are Human Resources Generalists or Business Partners. These 
human resources professionals could work in all areas or be labor relations 
representatives working with unionized employees.
